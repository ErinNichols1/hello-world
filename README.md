My name is Erin Nichols.  I have been married to my wife Tiffany for 13 years and we have 3 boys, Edison, Luke, and Lee.  I am currently active duty Army for almost 15 years.  Some of my hobbies are playing baseball with my boys, golfing with my friends and playing video games.  I have my bachelors degree from Southern New Hampshire University in BS in Data Analytics. My goal is to be completely retired in about 15 years so I can enjoy life on a golf course somewhere in Florida.
